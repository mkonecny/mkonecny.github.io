<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I am developer 3 years out of University who loves to code in his spare time. My best attributes related to development are passion and determination to make things work, and have them work as gracefully as possible.</p>

<h4>A good developer:</h4>

<p>Able to write not only code, but unit tests, as well as documentation.  </p>

<h4>Biggest Annoyance:</h4>

<p>Developers who fix symptoms, not the root cause.  </p>

<h4>Motto:</h4>

<p>"If you can't look at your code from six months ago and be disgusted, you aren't improving quick enough"</p>

<h4>Currently attempting to improve my:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Functional Programming</li>
<li>Schemaless Databases (NoSql)</li>
<li>Android development</li>
</ul><h2>Previous Experience</h2>

<h3>Progpad [diploma project, 2009]</h3>

<p>A real-time collaborative online editor where documents were synced to between user's browsers, similar to Google Docs and Etherpad. The project was based on PHP + MySQL backend, with a jQuery frontend, and was part of my diploma project. I do not maintain the site anymore, however my diploma paper on it is available here:<br><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/rx5cyojpy3fbiif/Web-Based%20Collaborative%20Real-Time%20Editor.pdf?dl=-1">https://www.dropbox.com/s/rx5cyojpy3fbiif/Web-Based%20Collaborative%20Real-Time%20Editor.pdf?dl=-1</a> - abstract

<h3>Airtime Web Radio [full-time employee, 2010 - present]</h3>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airtime">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airtime</a><br><a href="https://github.com/sourcefabric/Airtime">https://github.com/sourcefabric/Airtime</a><br><a href="http://www.sourcefabric.org/en/airtime/">http://www.sourcefabric.org/en/airtime/</a>  </p>

<p>I am currently the team lead of this project. I lead code-review with team members, as well as assign tickets, plan system architecture, as well as write code. Airtime runs on Debian (and CentOS unofficially) based systems, and has gained quite a community following.</p>

<p>Some users create their own videos, here is one example:<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqHs_jSYVOU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqHs_jSYVOU</a></p>

<p>We have some fairly popular sites reviewing us as well:<br><a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/10/open-source-radio-station-management-software-airtime-sees-release">http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/10/open-source-radio-station-management-software-airtime-sees-release</a></p>

<p>I also recently wrote a few blog posts about getting Airtime running on my Raspberry Pi:
<a href="http://www.sourcefabric.org/en/community/blog/1490/Airtime-and-the-Raspberry-Pi-part-1-Experiments-in-installation.htm">http://www.sourcefabric.org/en/community/blog/1490/Airtime-and-the-Raspberry-Pi-part-1-Experiments-in-installation.htm</a>
<a href="http://www.sourcefabric.org/en/community/blog/1574/Airtime-and-Raspberry-Pi-part-2-planning-for-peak-performance.htm">http://www.sourcefabric.org/en/community/blog/1574/Airtime-and-Raspberry-Pi-part-2-planning-for-peak-performance.htm</a></p>

<p>The main components Airtime uses is Apache, PHP 5.3 + Zend MVC, Postgresql and RabbitMQ.</p>

<p>A SaaS solution for Airtime is also available, and I am partially responsible for maintaining the server environment. Our SaaS environment uses nginx as a proxy to Apache - nginx is responsible for handling any DDoS attacks and Apache is responsible for serving static content and proxying to php-fpm.</p>

<h3>PlatinumAxis [side-project, 2012-2013]</h3>

<p><a href="http://platinumaxis.com/">http://platinumaxis.com/</a><br><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/platinumaxis/id584318980">https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/platinumaxis/id584318980</a> (iPhone app)<br><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=platinumaxis.android">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=platinumaxis.android</a> (Android app)  </p>

<p>An app written in my spare time with some friends that show users which clubs are the hottest in Toronto. How "hot" a club is, is based on a variety of metrics such as social media (twitter and many others), as well as user's own ratings from within the app. All of this is handled in the backend and powered by several Amazon EC2 instances. PHP, MongoDB and Python are used in the backend - I was solely responsible for the backend. I am also responsible for a major part of the Android app.</p>
