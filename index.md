Background

#### Currently exploring:
* Functional Programming
* Schemaless Databases (NoSQL)
* Android development

Previous Experience
------

### Airtime Web Radio [full-time employee, 2010 - present]
#### Project Team Lead + Senior Developer

http://www.sourcefabric.org/en/airtime/  

I am currently the team lead of this project. I lead code-review with team members, plan system architecture, and write code. Airtime runs on Debian (and CentOS unofficially) based systems, and has gained quite a community following.

Recently wrote a few blog posts about getting Airtime running on the Raspberry Pi:

http://www.sourcefabric.org/en/community/blog/1574/Airtime-and-Raspberry-Pi-part-2-planning-for-peak-performance.htm

The main components Airtime uses is Apache, PHP 5.3 + Zend MVC, Python (background services), PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ.

A SaaS solution for Airtime is also available, and part of my time is spent maintaining the server environment (LXC containers to sandbox each customer, Fabric (Python) framework to initialize instances, Gluster+Fuse as the network file system for each server cluster, Process watchdogs etc.).


### PlatinumAxis [side-project, 2012-2013]  
#### Senior Backend Developer

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=platinumaxis.android (Android app)  

An app collaboratively written in my spare time that show users which clubs are the hottest in Toronto. How "hot" a club is, is based on a variety of metrics such as social media (twitter and many others), as well as user's own ratings from within the app. All of this is handled in the backend and powered by several Amazon EC2 instances. PHP, MongoDB and Python are used in the backend - I was solely responsible for the backend. I am also responsible for a major part of the Android app.

### IBM Java Developer [2006-2010]
#### Student Contractor
Used JavaScript + HTML frontend, along with a Java Server backend to create a suite of internal management reporting tools. Worked with a team of 5, and worked with data that was analyzed + compiled into a suite of visual interactive reports for executives. Original length of term was supposed to be one summer, but was continuously extended while I finished my Bachelor/Master degrees.

### Progpad [diploma project, 2009]
A real-time collaborative online editor where documents were synced to between user's browsers, similar to Google Docs and Etherpad. The project was based on PHP + MySQL backend, with a jQuery frontend, and was part of my diploma project. I do not maintain the site anymore, however my diploma paper on it is available here:
