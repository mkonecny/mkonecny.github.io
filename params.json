My best attributes related to development are passion and determination to make things work, and have them work as gracefully as possible.\r\n\r\n#### Currently exploring:\r\n* Functional Programming\r\n* Schemaless Databases (NoSQL)\r\n* Android development\r\n\r\nPrevious Experience\r\n------\r\n\r\n### Airtime Web Radio [full-time employee, 2010 - present]\r\n#### Project Team Lead + Senior Developer\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airtime  \r\nhttps://github.com/sourcefabric/Airtime  \r\nhttp://www.sourcefabric.org/en/airtime/  \r\n\r\nI am currently the team lead of this project. I lead code-review with team members, plan system architecture, and write code. Airtime runs on Debian (and CentOS unofficially) based systems, and has gained quite a community following.\r\n\r\nRecently wrote a few blog posts about getting Airtime running on the Raspberry Pi:  \r\nhttp://www.sourcefabric.org/en/community/blog/1490/Airtime-and-the-Raspberry-Pi-part-1-Experiments-in-installation.htm  \r\nhttp://www.sourcefabric.org/en/community/blog/1574/Airtime-and-Raspberry-Pi-part-2-planning-for-peak-performance.htm\r\n\r\nThe main components Airtime uses is Apache, PHP 5.3 + Zend MVC, Python (background services), PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ.\r\n\r\nA SaaS solution for Airtime is also available, and part of my time is spent maintaining the server environment (LXC containers to sandbox each customer, Fabric (Python) framework to initialize instances, Gluster+Fuse as the network file system for each server cluster, Process watchdogs etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n### PlatinumAxis [side-project, 2012-2013]  \r\n#### Senior Backend Developer\r\nhttp://platinumaxis.com/  \r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/platinumaxis/id584318980 (iPhone app)  \r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=platinumaxis.android (Android app)  \r\n\r\nAn app collaboratively written in my spare time that show users which clubs are the hottest in Toronto. How \"hot\" a club is, is based on a variety of metrics such as social media (twitter and many others), as well as user's own ratings from within the app. All of this is handled in the backend and powered by several Amazon EC2 instances. PHP, MongoDB and Python are used in the backend - I was solely responsible for the backend. I am also responsible for a major part of the Android app.\r\n\r\n### IBM Java Developer [2006-2010]\r\n#### Junior Developer\r\nUsed JavaScript + HTML frontend, along with a Java Server backend to create a suite of internal management reporting tools. Worked with a team of 5, and worked with data that was analyzed + compiled into a suite of visual interactive reports for executives.\r\n\r\n### Progpad [diploma project, 2009]\r\nA real-time collaborative online editor where documents were synced to between user's browsers, similar to Google Docs and Etherpad. The project was based on PHP + MySQL backend, with a jQuery frontend, and was part of my diploma project. I do not maintain the site anymore, however my diploma paper on it is available here:  \r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/rx5cyojpy3fbiif/Web-Based%20Collaborative%20Real-Time%20Editor.pdf?dl=-1 - abstract\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/oko47jsm1bwsle8/MartinKonecnyDiploma.pdf?dl=1 - full paper\r\n\r\nExtracurricular\r\n------\r\n* Feb 26th 2012 - Gave public presentation on ASCII to Unicode - Evolution of Character Encodings @ Centre for Social Innovation. http://bit.ly/ZSfzGz\r\n\r\nEducation\r\n------\r\n\r\n* **Master Degree**: [Sept 2008 - June 2010]\r\n    * Completed the Computer Science Masters Degree Program at the Faculty of Information Technology of VUT (Vysoké učení technické) Brno, Czech Republic. Was ranked 16th out of 117 students.
