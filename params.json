My best attributes related to development are passion and determination to make things work, and have them work as gracefully as possible.\r\n\r\n#### Currently exploring:\r\n* Functional Programming\r\n* Schemaless Databases (NoSql)\r\n* Android development\r\n\r\nPrevious Experience\r\n------\r\n\r\n### Airtime Web Radio [full-time employee, 2010 - present]\r\n#### Project Team Lead\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airtime  \r\nhttps://github.com/sourcefabric/Airtime  \r\nhttp://www.sourcefabric.org/en/airtime/  \r\n\r\nI am currently the team lead of this project. I lead code-review with team members, as well as assign tickets, plan system architecture, as well as write code. Airtime runs on Debian (and CentOS unofficially) based systems, and has gained quite a community following.\r\n\r\nI also recently wrote a few blog posts about getting Airtime running on my Raspberry Pi:  \r\nhttp://www.sourcefabric.org/en/community/blog/1490/Airtime-and-the-Raspberry-Pi-part-1-Experiments-in-installation.htm  \r\nhttp://www.sourcefabric.org/en/community/blog/1574/Airtime-and-Raspberry-Pi-part-2-planning-for-peak-performance.htm\r\n\r\nThe main components Airtime uses is Apache, PHP 5.3 + Zend MVC, Python (background services), PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ.\r\n\r\nA SaaS solution for Airtime is also available, and part of my time is spent maintaining the server environment (LXC containers to sandbox each customer, Fabric (Python) framework to initialize instances, Gluster+Fuse as the network file system for each server cluster, Process watchdog etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n### PlatinumAxis [side-project, 2012-2013]  \r\n#### Senior Backend Developer\r\nhttp://platinumaxis.com/  \r\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/platinumaxis/id584318980 (iPhone app)  \r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=platinumaxis.android (Android app)  \r\n\r\nAn app collaboratively written in my spare time that show users which clubs are the hottest in Toronto. How \"hot\" a club is, is based on a variety of metrics such as social media (twitter and many others), as well as user's own ratings from within the app. All of this is handled in the backend and powered by several Amazon EC2 instances. PHP, MongoDB and Python are used in the backend - I was solely responsible for the backend. I am also responsible for a major part of the Android app.\r\n\r\n### IBM Web-tools [Student co-op 2006-2010]\r\n#### Application Developer\r\nUsed JavaScript and Flex, with a Java backend to create a suite of internal management reporting tools. Was hired on call for 3 years after a successful summer position. \r\n\r\n### Progpad [diploma project, 2009]\r\nA real-time collaborative online editor where documents were synced to between user's browsers, similar to Google Docs and Etherpad. The project was based on PHP + MySQL backend, with a jQuery frontend, and was part of my diploma project. I do not maintain the site anymore, however my diploma paper on it is available here:  \r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/rx5cyojpy3fbiif/Web-Based%20Collaborative%20Real-Time%20Editor.pdf?dl=-1 - abstract\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/oko47jsm1bwsle8/MartinKonecnyDiploma.pdf?dl=1 - full paper\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation\r\n------\r\n\r\n* **Master Degree**: [Sept 2008 - June 2010]\r\n    * Completed the Computer Science Masters Degree Program at the Faculty of Information Technology of VUT (Vysoké učení technické) Brno, Czech Republic.
